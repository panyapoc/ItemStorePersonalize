    "\n",
    "The base dataset is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large** - We're only trying to create a representative demo here, not needlessly consume lots of resources\n",
    "2. **Sparse** - Since views > purchases > reviews, only a fraction of products (and users) have multiple reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "UCSD's published data already helps with this, by offering **5-core reviews** subsets pre-filtered to include only the reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "* by users who've written 5 or more reviews\n",
    "* for products that received 5 or more reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "If we focus on one particular product category (say, _\"Sports and Outdoors\"_ or _\"Grocery and Gourmet Food\"_) then this gets us to a nice manageable volume of reviews for training demo recommender engines - great!\n",
    "\n",
    "...The only remaining problem is that there **aren't 5-core filtered versions of the product metadata files**... So our demo's start-up time (populating the products database) would still be unacceptable! 😭\n"

    "\n",
    "* Assuming the parsed 5-core reviews dataset fits in to memory (so lookups are performant), but the full category product list doesn't (so streaming is necessary)\n",
    "* Preserving the data format (so users can relate it to the source dataset, and the workshop can still do some of the more \"real\" data pre-processing)\n",
    "\n",
